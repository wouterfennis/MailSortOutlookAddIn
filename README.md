# MailSortOutlookAddIn
Outlook 2013 -2016 AddIn for automatically sort email.

If there are folders present with the same name as the email sender name. Then these email's can be automatically sorted after being read.

BUG:
  - The logic to find the matching folder has been completed. But the actual move function fires an exception without much explanation
